# Debtor Journey & Workflows

## Simplified Debtor Lifecycle

The current system focuses on email tracking, payment processing, and manual workflow management rather than automated AI responses.

### 1. Email Communication Flow

**Inbound Email Processing**

```
Trigger: Debtor sends email reply
Action: Webhook receives and processes email
Process:
1. AWS SES receives email â†’ webhook to /api/webhooks/email/received
2. System parses email and identifies debtor by email address
3. Email stored in database with messageId and threading info
4. Email content available for manual review and response
5. Engagement metrics updated (email received, response time)

Tracking:
- Email received timestamp
- Sender identification
- Basic threading via In-Reply-To headers
- Content stored for future reference
```

**Outbound Email Sending**

```
Trigger: Manual initiation or system event (payment, receipt)
Action: Send email via AWS SES
Process:
1. Generate email using Tailwind templates
2. Send via AWS SES SendEmail API
3. Log outbound email in database
4. Track delivery status and engagement

Email Types:
- Initial contact emails
- Payment confirmation receipts
- Payment reminder emails
- Settlement offer emails
```

### 2. Debtor Response Scenarios

**Scenario A: Email Reply Received**

```
Webhook: /api/webhooks/email/received processes debtor reply
Process:
1. Parse and store email content in database
2. Identify debtor by email address matching
3. Update email thread with new message
4. Flag for manual review and response
5. Track engagement metrics

Manual Review Process:
- Staff reviews email content and context
- Determine appropriate response (payment plan, dispute, information)
- Send personalized response via email system
- Update debtor status and notes
```

**Scenario B: Payment Page Visit**

```
Event: Debtor visits /pay/:token
Process:
1. Log page visit with timestamp
2. Track payment page engagement
3. Record payment method selections
4. Store completion or abandonment data
5. Use data for follow-up planning

Page Analytics:
- Time spent on page
- Payment method selected
- Form completion vs abandonment
- Mobile vs desktop usage
- Return visits
```

### 3. Payment Processing Workflows

**Successful Payment Flow**

```
1. Debtor completes Stripe checkout
2. Webhook: /api/webhooks/stripe payment_intent.succeeded
3. System updates debt balance and status
4. Automatic receipt email sent via template
5. Update debtor status to "paid" or "partial payment"
6. Remove from active collection sequences (manual)
7. Log complete payment transaction
```

**Failed Payment Flow**

```
1. Payment attempt fails (declined card, insufficient funds)
2. Webhook: /api/webhooks/stripe payment_intent.payment_failed
3. System logs failed payment attempt
4. Flag for manual follow-up with alternative options
5. Staff can send targeted emails about other payment methods
6. Schedule follow-up contact as needed
```

**Payment Plan Setup**

```
1. Debtor requests payment plan (email or phone)
2. Staff manually sets up Stripe subscription
3. First payment processed immediately
4. System tracks payment plan compliance
5. Manual reminders sent before each due date
6. Collections resume if plan defaults (manual process)
```

```

### 6. Engagement Tracking
