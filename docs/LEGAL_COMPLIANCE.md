# Legal Compliance

## Executive Summary

Operating a debt collection agency requires strict federal and state compliance. Non-compliance penalties range from $500-$1,500 per violation with potential business shutdown. Focus on core requirements for Texas-based operations with AI automation.

**Critical Compliance Priorities:**

-   FDCPA/Regulation F compliance
-   TCPA compliance for AI calling
-   Texas state licensing
-   Essential documentation systems

## Texas State Requirements

**License Registration:**

-   Register with Texas Secretary of State as debt collection agency
-   $10,000 surety bond required
-   Annual renewal and reporting
-   Local municipal permits may be required

**Timeline:** Complete within 30 days of operations

## Federal Compliance Essentials

### FDCPA Core Requirements

**Communication Rules:**

-   Contact hours: 8 AM - 9 PM consumer's local time only
-   Maximum 7 calls per week per debt
-   Must cease contact if requested in writing
-   Debt validation notice within 5 days of initial contact

**Prohibited Practices:**

-   Harassment, threats, or abusive language
-   False representations about debt amount or consequences
-   Contacting third parties about consumer debts
-   Calling consumers at work if prohibited

### TCPA Compliance for AI Systems

**CRITICAL:** AI calling without proper consent = $500-$1,500 per call violation

**Safe Approach:**

-   Require explicit written consent before any auto-dialed calls
-   Use manual dialing until consent systems are robust
-   Maintain comprehensive consent records
-   Implement immediate opt-out mechanisms

**AI Voice Calling:** Recommend delaying until Month 6+ due to complexity

### CFPB Regulation F (2021)

**Call Frequency Limits:**

-   No more than 7 calls per week per debt
-   No calls for 7 days after consumer conversation
-   Applies to all communication attempts

**Required Disclosures:**

-   Use model validation notice (safe harbor protection)
-   Include debt collector identification
-   Provide consumer rights information
-   Clear response instructions

## Essential Documentation

**Must Maintain (7-year retention):**

-   All consumer communications (calls, emails, letters)
-   Debt purchase agreements and account documentation
-   Validation notices sent and responses received
-   Payment records and dispute resolutions
-   Consent records for all communications

**Daily Operations:**

-   Log all consumer contacts within 24 hours
-   Record call outcomes and next actions
-   Track compliance with call frequency limits
-   Document any consumer disputes immediately

## High-Risk Areas to Avoid

1. **Time-Barred Debts:** Verify statute of limitations before collection
2. **Medical Debts:** Additional federal protections apply
3. **Third-Party Contacts:** Extremely limited circumstances only
4. **Credit Reporting:** Must verify accuracy before reporting
