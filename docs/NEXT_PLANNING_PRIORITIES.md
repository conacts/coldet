## Implementation Decision Points

### Technical Stack Decisions Needed
1. **Database:** PostgreSQL vs MySQL vs MongoDB
2. **Hosting:** AWS vs GCP vs Vercel (for different components)
3. **AI Provider:** OpenAI vs Claude vs combination approach
4. **Monitoring:** DataDog vs New Relic vs custom solution

### Business Process Decisions Needed
1. **Debt Acquisition:** Start with portfolio purchase vs broker relationships
2. **Staffing:** Fully automated vs minimal human oversight
3. **Geographic Scope:** Texas-only vs multi-state expansion plan
4. **Client Types:** Focus on specific debt types vs diversified approach

## Risk Mitigation Planning

### Technical Risks
- **API Rate Limits:** Plan for SendGrid, Twilio, Stripe, OpenAI limits
- **Webhook Reliability:** Implement retry mechanisms and monitoring
- **Data Security:** PCI compliance and PII protection measures
- **Scalability:** Database and API performance under load

### Business Risks
- **Regulatory Changes:** Monitor CFPB and state law updates
- **Collection Performance:** Backup strategies if AI conversion rates are low
- **Client Acquisition:** Alternative debt sources if initial approach fails
- **Competition:** Differentiation strategy against established agencies

## Success Metrics Definition

### Technical KPIs
- Email webhook processing: <500ms response time
- Payment page load: <2 seconds
- AI response generation: <30 seconds
- System uptime: 99.9%

### Business KPIs
- Collection rate: 25%+ (above industry 20% average)
- Payment conversion: 15%+ click-to-pay from emails
- Call contact rate: 25%+ live connections
- Average resolution time: <30 days

## Next Steps Recommendation

**This Week:** Focus on Service Integration Specifications (#1)
**Reason:** These are blocking all development work and have long setup times

**Next Week:** Tackle Compliance Implementation Details (#2)  
**Reason:** Legal requirements must be architected from the beginning

**Following Weeks:** AI Strategy ‚Üí Payment Workflows ‚Üí Operations

This planning approach ensures we have complete specifications before any development begins, minimizing costly changes during implementation.
