# AI Calling Compliance Strategy

## Critical Question

Can we legally use AI to call debtors whose debt we've purchased?

## TCPA Requirements

### What You CAN Do

**Purchased Debt Rights:**

-   Legal right to collect the debt
-   Right to contact via mail, email
-   Right to call landlines (no consent needed)
-   Right to manually dial cell phones (1 call/day max)

### What You CANNOT Do (Without Consent)

**TCPA Violations (up to $1,500/call):**

-   Auto-dial cell phones without written consent
-   Use AI/robo-calls to cell phones without consent
-   Call cell phones using predictive dialers
-   Send auto-text messages without consent

## AI Calling Strategies

### Option 1: Consent-First Approach (SAFEST)

**Process:**

1. Mail consent request forms
2. Email opt-in links
3. Only call those who provide written consent
4. Use AI calling for consented numbers only

**Pros:**

-   Full TCPA compliance
-   Zero violation risk
-   AI efficiency for consented calls

**Cons:**

-   Lower response rates (5-15% consent rate)
-   Slower initial contact
-   Reduced portfolio value

### Option 2: Manual-Then-AI Approach

**Process:**

1. Manual dial cell phones first
2. Obtain verbal consent during live calls
3. Document consent in CRM
4. Use AI for follow-up calls to consented numbers

**Pros:**

-   Higher contact rates initially
-   Legal verbal consent collection
-   AI efficiency for follow-ups

**Cons:**

-   More time-intensive initially
-   Need human agents for first contact
-   Complex consent tracking

### Option 3: Landline-Only AI (RISKY)

**Process:**

1. Use AI only for landline numbers
2. Manual dial all cell phones
3. Skip cell phone numbers without consent

**Pros:**

-   Immediate AI deployment
-   Lower operational overhead
-   Reduced legal risk

**Cons:**

-   Miss majority of contacts (80%+ are cell phones)
-   Severely limited reach
-   Poor ROI on portfolios

## Compliance Infrastructure Needed

### Required Systems

-   Consent management database
-   Call recording with disclaimers
-   Do Not Call (DNC) list integration
-   TCPA-compliant dialing rules
-   Real-time compliance monitoring

### Documentation Requirements

-   Written consent forms
-   Call scripts with disclosures
-   Consent verification procedures
-   Violation tracking system

## Recommendation

**Option 1: Consent-First Approach** - Sacrifice some initial efficiency for zero legal risk. Build consent collection into your competitive advantage.

**Implementation:**

1. Design compelling consent collection process
2. Use AI for marketing consent collection
3. Build world-class AI calling for consented numbers
4. Market "ethical AI collection" as differentiator

## Risk Assessment

-   **TCPA violations:** $500-1,500 per illegal call
-   **Class action risk:** Millions in potential damages
-   **Business shutdown risk:** FTC/CFPB enforcement
