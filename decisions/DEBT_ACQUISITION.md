# Debt Acquisition Strategy

## Decision Required

How should we acquire debt portfolios to collect on?

## Acquisition Methods

### Option 1: Purchase Aged Portfolios

**Strategy:** Buy delinquent accounts directly from debt sellers
**Time to Start:** 2-4 weeks
**Pros:**

-   Immediate inventory to work on
-   Own the debt = higher potential returns
-   No client relationships needed initially
-   Can start collecting immediately after purchase

**Cons:**

-   Requires upfront capital (8-12% of face value)
-   Higher risk (if recovery fails, lose investment)
-   Older debt = lower recovery rates (8-15%)
-   Need to build own buyer network

**Capital Requirements:**

-   $25k could buy ~$200k-300k face value debt
-   Expected recovery: $16k-45k (if 8-15% recovery rate)
-   Profit margin: Lower but faster

### Option 2: Debt Brokers/Placement Networks

**Strategy:** Work with intermediaries who place debt from multiple sources
**Time to Start:** 4-8 weeks
**Pros:**

-   No upfront capital required
-   Commission-based (30-35%)
-   Faster relationship building
-   Mixed debt ages/quality

**Cons:**

-   Need broker relationships
-   Competition with other agencies
-   Less control over debt quality
-   Split commissions with brokers

**Capital Requirements:**

-   Minimal upfront ($2k-5k for systems)
-   Revenue based on performance
-   More predictable cash flow

### Option 3: Direct Bank Partnerships

**Strategy:** Contract directly with banks, credit unions, fintech lenders
**Time to Start:** 3-6 months
**Pros:**

-   Fresh debt (higher recovery rates 20-35%)
-   Long-term contracts
-   Highest commission rates
-   Best quality portfolios

**Cons:**

-   Longest sales cycles
-   Need proven track record
-   Extensive vetting process
-   High competition

**Capital Requirements:**

-   Moderate ($5k-15k for setup/bonding)
-   Highest long-term returns
-   Most stable business model

## Recommendation

**Start with Option 1 (Purchase Aged Portfolios)** for immediate cash flow, then transition to Option 2 (Brokers) while building toward Option 3 (Direct Partnerships).

**Hybrid Approach Timeline:**

-   Month 1-3: Purchase 2-3 small portfolios ($5k-8k each)
-   Month 2-4: Establish broker relationships
-   Month 6-12: Pursue direct bank partnerships

## Decision Timeline

Need to decide by: **Week 1** (affects licensing requirements and platform development)
